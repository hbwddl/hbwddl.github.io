This cluster began in 2017 when I realized that the University of Utah sold entire computers (sans hard drives) for 30 dollars at their surplus store. Once I had an entire extra computer, I needed something to do with it. I'd used one of UCLA's clusters during my BIG summer research experience, and I wanted to learn more about it.

I bought a refurbished hard drive, installed [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) on it, and started searching for easy ways to do that. I tried ready-made HPC distros/packages such as [PelicanHPC](https://www.pelicanhpc.org/) and [KestrelHPC](http://kestrelhpc.sourceforge.net/).

After three or so years of wrangling this cluster on-and-off, I've finally settled on a setup that feels sustainable. I've got four nodes in my cluster, and I'm currently running an [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) cluster, learning how to use Sparklyr for machine learning workflows. I've also got MPI capabilities on my cluster.
