I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University. My faculty advisor is Lance Waller. I am interested in spatial and environmental statistics, statistical consulting, and other collaborative projects.
