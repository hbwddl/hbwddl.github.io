I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University. My dissertation research focuses on phylodynamic modeling which reconstructs infectious disease outbreaks while accounting for the full genetic diversity of the pathogen population present. I also have a particular interest in computational scalability, high-dimension data imputation via data-augmentation MCMC, and pathogen genomic data. My dissertation advisors are Max Lau and Lance Waller. I am interested in infectious disease and vaccine modeling, agent-based modeling, and statistical software + computation.

I regularly collaborate with researchers across the schools of medicine and public health, and I have 5+ years of experience as a collaborative biostatistician.
