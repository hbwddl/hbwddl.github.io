2D "density" generator
------
For some of my movement modeling work, I wanted a quick way to generate a 2d spatial "density" for the purposes of simulations. This application generates a function defined over a 2-dimensional square by overlaying multiple bivariate normal distributions on top of each other. I keep saying "density", because the function doesn't necessarily integrate to 1.

Applied Spatial Statistics for Public Health Data
------
Found on my [github](https://github.com/hbwddl/Bios-737-Applied-Spatial-2019). This repository contains my code for the course Bios 737, which I took in Fall 2019. The course primarily focused on spatial point processes.
