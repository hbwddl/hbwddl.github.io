I have been a TA for BIOS 591P since 2020. This is the second statistics course that epidemiology students take at Rollins School of Public Health and covers ANOVA, linear regression, logistic regression, and some survival analysis. Epidemiology students at Rollins have SAS training, but there has been an increased focus on R in recent years. As part of my duties in this class, I have converted the course materials and analysis written in SAS to R code. I also run weekly R recitations for students who want to learn how to use R.

## Materials

[R Self Study](https://github.com/hbwddl/hbwddl.github.io/blob/master/files/R-Resources.pdf): I distribute this document to students which gives a fairly robust listing of R resources for troubleshooting and self-teaching.
